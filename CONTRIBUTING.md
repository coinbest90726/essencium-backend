## How to Report a Bug

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not** open an issue. Instead, please email us at [essencium@frachtwerk.de](mailto:essencium@frachtwerk.de) directly, so we can address it promptly and confidentially. For reporting non-security-related bugs, we appreciate if you can use our bug report template, which provides a structured format for gathering essential information to reproduce and understand the issue.

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

We encourage suggestions for new features or enhancements that align with the project's roadmap, goals, and development philosophy. Before submitting a suggestion, please review our existing documentation and discussions to ensure it hasn't been proposed before. If it's a novel idea, feel free to suggest it through the appropriate channels, providing clear and concise information about the feature's purpose and potential benefits.

## Code Review Process

Code reviews are an essential part of maintaining code quality and consistency. Our project follows a peer review process, where designated reviewers provide feedback on submitted pull requests. Once a pull request is approved, one of the project maintainers will merge it. Contributors can expect to receive feedback within a reasonable timeframe, and communication regarding the progress of their contributions will be conducted through the pull request comments.

To ensure smooth collaboration, contributors are not granted direct commit access. However, exceptional contributors who consistently provide valuable contributions may be.

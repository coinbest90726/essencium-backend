# Essencium Postman Collection

Essencium comes with a Postman collection that provides pre-built request examples for every endpoint offered by the essencium's backend. In addition, a Postman [Pre-Request Script](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/pre-request-scripts/) runs before every request to automatically fetch a new token, that is referenced in authenticated request with `{{TOKEN}}`. This way, you do not have to manually fetch, copy and paste a token for every request you make it Postman.
